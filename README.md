# SpartaHack8: Neural Network to classify road safety hazards.

This was the project we worked on in the 'Social Good' category of SpartaHack8. It uses a streamlit-built website that runs a tensorflow based Neural Network to categorize and classify user-uploaded images. 

Training images were from:
S. Nienaber, R.S. Kroon, M.J. Booysen, “A Comparison of Low-Cost Monocular Vision Techniques for Pothole Distance Estimation”, IEEE CIVTS, December 2015, Cape Town, South Africa (10) (PDF) Dataset of images used for pothole detection.
